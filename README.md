## Current Version v0.6.0-alpha
Saving and loading is now in! I hope this adds more accessibility!

## Made For
[r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/)'s 2021 Run of the [Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/)

## Project Goal
Make a 'moddable' roguelike in Godot.

## Making a Map
For a map to be accepted, it must be the same width in characters (subject to change.) Important characters are '#' for walls, '@' for you player, and '>' to proceed to next level. More characters are hoped to be added later. Currently 'Y', 'D', 'r', and 'X' all have a use.

## How to Contribute
This is mainly a personal learning project, so create issues, enter discussion, or make your own fork.
