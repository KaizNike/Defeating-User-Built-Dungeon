 Godot text-based roguelike where you supply the levels.
 [Play on itch](https://kaizarnike.itch.io/defeating-user-built-dungeon)
 Uses Godot v4.3 (awaiting full release)

![Banner Fifth Version, A Dungeon with many rats](.//v0.7-alpha-screen4.png)

## Current Version v0.21.1-alpha
Godot Text to Speech Implemented, Still Iterating

## Made For
[r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/)'s 2021 Run of the [Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/)

## Project Goal
Make a 'moddable' roguelike in Godot. Really one that anyone can make maps for.

## Making a Map
Important characters are '#' for walls, '@' for you the player, and '>' to proceed to next level. More characters are hoped to be added later. Currently 'Y', 'D', 'r', and 'X' all have a use.

Try 'n' for a hostile foe that makes looting annoying.
